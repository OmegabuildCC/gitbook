# Leveling

The **leveling system** is part of the economy system. By gaining XP on the server, which is earned by playing different game modes, the player can level up based on the caps of XP set for each level.

Each time when a player levels up, a new perk is gained, which is displayed in **/XP perks**. When a player reaches level 100, they are no longer allowed to level up, but are recommended to prestige to start anew, which resets their economy progress and gain new perks. (See [prestige.md](../prestige.md "mention"))
