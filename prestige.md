# Prestige

Prestige are part of the economy system. When a player reaches level 100 (see [leveling.md](economy/leveling.md "mention")), they are allowed to prestige. Prestiging erases their leveling and currency status. In return, they get a new perk, alongside the leveling of their Prestige prefix.

Below are the perks associated with each prestige level.
